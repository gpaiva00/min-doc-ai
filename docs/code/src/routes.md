The `routes` directory contains the routing configuration for the application. This directory is responsible for defining the routes that the application will use to handle incoming requests.

The `routes` directory is organized into subdirectories, each containing a set of routes that are related to a specific feature or functionality of the application.

Here is a list of the subdirectories and files in the `routes` directory:

* `routes.tsx`: This file contains the main routing configuration for the application. It defines the routes that the application will use to handle incoming requests.
* `Hero`: This subdirectory contains the routes related to the Hero feature of the application.
* `Home`: This subdirectory contains the routes related to the Home feature of the application.

Each route in the `routes` directory is defined using the `Route` component from the `react-router-dom` library. The `Route` component is used to define a route that will be used to handle incoming requests.

Here is an example of a route definition:
```jsx
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const HeroRoute = () => {
  return <div>Hello from Hero Route!</div>;
};

export default Route('/hero', HeroRoute);
```
This route definition defines a route that will be used to handle incoming requests to the `/hero` URL. The `HeroRoute` component is rendered when the route is matched.

I hope this documentation helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
