Here is the generated documentation in Markdown format:

---
title: assets
description: 'Documentation for the assets directory'
---

The `assets` directory contains static files used by the application.

This directory is used to store files that are not related to the application's code, such as images, fonts, and other static assets.

Note: This directory is not intended to be modified or updated by the application's code. Any changes made to this directory should be done manually.

That's it!
