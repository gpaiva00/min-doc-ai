# components

The `components` directory contains reusable UI components for the application.

## Description

This directory contains a collection of reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application. These components are designed to be modular and easy to use, making it easy to build and maintain the application's UI.

## Components

* `Footer.tsx`: A reusable footer component that can be used to display footer content.
* `Guide.tsx`: A reusable guide component that can be used to display step-by-step guides.
* `Header.tsx`: A reusable header component that can be used to display header content.
* `Mermaid.tsx`: A reusable Mermaid component that can be used to display Mermaid diagrams.
* `SwaggerDoc.tsx`: A reusable SwaggerDoc component that can be used to display Swagger documentation.

## Usage

To use a component, simply import it from the `components` directory and use it in your application. For example:
```jsx
import { Footer } from 'src/shared/components';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};
```
Note that each component has its own documentation and usage instructions, which can be found in the component's README file or in the component's documentation.
