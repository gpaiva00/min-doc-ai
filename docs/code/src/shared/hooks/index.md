The `useQueryState` hook is a utility function that allows you to manage query state in your application. It is exported from the `src/shared/hooks/useQueryState.ts` file.

This hook is used to manage query state by providing a way to set and get query parameters. It is a useful tool for managing complex query strings and providing a way to easily switch between different query states.

Here is an example of how to use the `useQueryState` hook:
```typescript
import { useQueryState } from '../hooks/useQueryState';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [queryState, setQueryState] = useQueryState();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setQueryState({ foo: 'bar' })}>
        Set query state
      </button>
      <p>Query state: {JSON.stringify(queryState)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, the `useQueryState` hook is used to manage query state in the `MyComponent` component. The `setQueryState` function is used to set the query state, and the `queryState` variable is used to get the current query state.

Note that the `useQueryState` hook is a utility function and does not have any dependencies. It is a simple and lightweight hook that can be easily integrated into your application.
