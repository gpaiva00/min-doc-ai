# Guide

The Guide component is a reusable UI component that provides a structured layout for displaying guides, tutorials, and other types of content.

## Props

The Guide component accepts a single prop, `translation`, which is an instance of the `TFunction` type from `i18next`.

## Usage

To use the Guide component, simply import it and pass the required props:
```jsx
import { Guide } from './Guide';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Guide translation={t} />
  );
};
```
## Component Structure

The Guide component consists of several sections, each with its own heading and content. The sections are:

* **Overview**: A brief introduction to the guide.
* **Requests and Responses**: A list of available API endpoints and their descriptions.
* **Best Practices**: A list of recommended best practices for using the API.
* **Support**: Contact information for support and troubleshooting.

Each section is rendered using a combination of HTML elements and internationalized strings.

## Internationalization

The Guide component uses the `i18next` library to internationalize its content. The `translation` prop is used to inject the translated strings into the component.

## Environment Variables

The Guide component uses environment variables to determine the current environment (e.g. development, production). The `APP_ENV` variable is used to determine the environment and display the corresponding text.
