# Hero

The Hero component is a React component used to display the hero section of the Fastpay application.

## Import

The Hero component imports the following:

* `Link` from `react-router-dom`
* `Cards` from `@/assets`
* `Footer`, `Header`, and `useLanguage` from `@/shared`
* `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardDescription`, `CardHeader`, and `CardTitle` from `@/shared/components/ui/card`
* `Button` from `@/shared/components/ui/button`
* `ArrowRightLeft`, `CreditCard`, `GalleryHorizontalEnd`, and `Shield` from `lucide-react`
* `useMemo` from `react`

## Function

The Hero function is a React function component that returns a JSX element. It uses the `useLanguage` hook to get the current language and translation, and the `t` function to translate the text.

The Hero function returns a JSX element that contains:

* A `Header` component with the current language and translation
* A `main` element with a grid layout containing:
	+ A `div` element with a flex layout containing:
		- A `h2` element with the Fastpay logo
		- A `h1` element with the hero title
		- A `p` element with the hero description
		- A `Button` component with the hero button
	+ An `img` element with the cards image
* A `section` element with a flex layout containing:
	+ A `Card` component for each card in the `CARDS` array

## Export

The Hero component is exported as a named export.
