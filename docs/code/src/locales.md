The `locales` directory contains translations for the application. This directory is used to store language files for the application.

The structure of this directory is as follows:
```
locales/
en.ts
pt-BR.ts
...
```
Each file in this directory represents a language and contains translations for the application. The file name is in the format `languageCode.ts`, where `languageCode` is the ISO 639-1 code for the language.

For example, the `en.ts` file contains translations for the English language, while the `pt-BR.ts` file contains translations for the Portuguese (Brazil) language.

This directory is used by the application to load the correct translations for the user's preferred language.
